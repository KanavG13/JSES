# JSES
A web app made with React and crypto-js for various hashings, encodings and encryptions.
## TODO
1. Add encryptions (~~AES~~, RSA), HMACs (For inputs in AES/RSA add Base64 option)
2. Add chaining (md5+md5+sha1.... any custom chain) and probably persist with local storage
3. Improve designing specially for mobile
